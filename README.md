This was a second iteration of a program me and my friend had made to help explain certain Algorithms to our peers in High School. In retrospect, there were probably better alternative services to help them with that, but it was a fun Project for us nonetheless.

We tried to divide algorithms into logical sections (for e.g, clean up code, variable modifying code, etc), and-

Before executing any section of code, the user could look at some accompanying explanations. (for e.g, what does setting a variable to -1 achieve in the grand scheme of things)

We could then execute that section of code and have a look at the data stored to see how they were affected by the execution of the code. For variables that can be interpretted as being a part of a logical entity such as a 'Tree' or 'Chain' of variables, we could also see the changes reflected in the form of Tree/Chain diagrams. For example, we have a Queue:

The alphabets I, J, K, L, M, N & O were inserted into this Queue in alphabetical order (the data in the 'Item' column) but as you can see in the diagram, the order appears jumbled up. However, consider the chain diagram representation of this data now.

If you look at this alongside the chain representation of this data, you'll see that the pointer values allow matching up the data items in the order they are meant to be percieved. We tried our best in the logs to explain the nuances to how the distorted representation in the table was coming together in the end. 

And so on.
